        <p> <blockquote>Ever wondered where all that drive to be #1 comes from? Well, Gates’ parents always encouraged competition by means of rewards and penalties</blockquote> taught him about sharing success. Gates was so absorbed by operating systems that he got banned from school for being caught exploiting bugs, then he decided to drop out of Harvard to start his own business. He thought that if this would prove to be a bad idea, he could always go back to school. He obviously nailed it!

            One of the world’s top philanthropists, Bill Gates is as generous and giving as he is wealthy and successful. Gates is investing a big part of his fortune in making the world a better place for the poor. He saved over 5 million lives by bringing vaccines and improving children healthcare; throughout his life, he donated half of his current worth; he invested in a foundation that supports many health, social and education developments, and the list goes on.
